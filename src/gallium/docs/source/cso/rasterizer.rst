Rasterizer
==========

The rasterizer state controls the rendering of points, lines and triangles.
Attributes include polygon culling state, line width, line stipple,
multisample state, scissoring and flat/smooth shading.

Shading
-------

flatshade
^^^^^^^^^

If set, the provoking vertex of each polygon is used to determine the color
of the entire polygon.  If not set, fragment colors will be interpolated
between the vertex colors.

The actual interpolated shading algorithm is obviously
implementation-dependent, but will usually be Gourard for most hardware.

.. note::

    This is separate from the fragment shader input attributes
    CONSTANT, LINEAR and PERSPECTIVE. The flatshade state is needed at
    clipping time to determine how to set the color of new vertices.

    :ref:`Draw` can implement flat shading by copying the provoking vertex
    color to all the other vertices in the primitive.

flatshade_first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whether the first vertex should be the provoking vertex, for most primitives.
If not set, the last vertex is the provoking vertex.

There are several important exceptions to the specification of this rule.

* ``PIPE_PRIMITIVE_POLYGON``: The provoking vertex is always the first
  vertex. If the caller wishes to change the provoking vertex, they merely
  need to rotate the vertices themselves.
* ``PIPE_PRIMITIVE_QUAD``, ``PIPE_PRIMITIVE_QUAD_STRIP``: This option has no
  effect; the provoking vertex is always the last vertex.
* ``PIPE_PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLE_FAN``: When set, the provoking vertex is the
  second vertex, not the first. This permits each segment of the fan to have
  a different color.

Points
------

sprite_coord_enable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specifies if a texture unit has its texture coordinates replaced or not. This
is a packed bitfield containing the enable for all texcoords -- if all bits
are zero, point sprites are effectively disabled. If any bit is set, then
point_smooth and point_quad_rasterization are ignored; point smoothing is
disabled and points are always rasterized as quads. If enabled, the four
vertices of the resulting quad will be assigned texture coordinates,
according to sprite_coord_mode.

sprite_coord_mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specifies how the value for each shader output should be computed when drawing
point sprites. For PIPE_SPRITE_COORD_LOWER_LEFT, the lower-left vertex will
have coordinates (0,0,0,1). For PIPE_SPRITE_COORD_UPPER_LEFT, the upper-left
vertex will have coordinates (0,0,0,1).
This state is used by :ref:`Draw` to generate texcoords.

.. note::

    When geometry shaders are available, a special geometry shader could be
    used instead of this functionality, to convert incoming points into quads
    with the proper texture coordinates.

point_quad_rasterization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Determines if points should be rasterized as quads or points. Certain APIs,
like Direct3D, always use quad rasterization for points, regardless of
whether point sprites are enabled or not. If this state is enabled, point
smoothing and antialiasing are disabled. If it is disabled, point sprite
coordinates are not generated.

.. note::

   Some renderers always internally translate points into quads; this state
   still affects those renderers by overriding other rasterization state.

Other Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

light_twoside
    If set, there are per-vertex back-facing colors. :ref:`Draw`
    uses this state along with the front/back information to set the
    final vertex colors prior to rasterization.

front_winding
    Indicates the window order of front-facing polygons, either
    PIPE_WINDING_CW or PIPE_WINDING_CCW

cull_mode
    Indicates which polygons to cull, either PIPE_WINDING_NONE (cull no
    polygons), PIPE_WINDING_CW (cull clockwise-winding polygons),
    PIPE_WINDING_CCW (cull counter clockwise-winding polygons), or
    PIPE_WINDING_BOTH (cull all polygons).

fill_cw
    Indicates how to fill clockwise polygons, either PIPE_POLYGON_MODE_FILL,
    PIPE_POLYGON_MODE_LINE or PIPE_POLYGON_MODE_POINT.
fill_ccw
    Indicates how to fill counter clockwise polygons, either
    PIPE_POLYGON_MODE_FILL, PIPE_POLYGON_MODE_LINE or PIPE_POLYGON_MODE_POINT.

poly_stipple_enable
    Whether polygon stippling is enabled.
poly_smooth
    Controls OpenGL-style polygon smoothing/antialiasing
offset_cw
    If set, clockwise polygons will have polygon offset factors applied
offset_ccw
    If set, counter clockwise polygons will have polygon offset factors applied
offset_units
    Specifies the polygon offset bias
offset_scale
    Specifies the polygon offset scale

line_width
    The width of lines.
line_smooth
    Whether lines should be smoothed. Line smoothing is simply anti-aliasing.
line_stipple_enable
    Whether line stippling is enabled.
line_stipple_pattern
    16-bit bitfield of on/off flags, used to pattern the line stipple.
line_stipple_factor
    When drawing a stippled line, each bit in the stipple pattern is
    repeated N times, where N = line_stipple_factor + 1.
line_last_pixel
    Controls whether the last pixel in a line is drawn or not.  OpenGL
    omits the last pixel to avoid double-drawing pixels at the ends of lines
    when drawing connected lines.

point_smooth
    Whether points should be smoothed. Point smoothing turns rectangular
    points into circles or ovals.
point_size_per_vertex
    Whether vertices have a point size element.
point_size
    The size of points, if not specified per-vertex.

scissor
    Whether the scissor test is enabled.

multisample
    Whether :term:`MSAA` is enabled.

gl_rasterization_rules
    Whether the rasterizer should use (0.5, 0.5) pixel centers. When not set,
    the rasterizer will use (0, 0) for pixel centers.
